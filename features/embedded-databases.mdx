title: Embedded Replicas
---

Turso's embedded replicas are a game-changer for SQLite, making it more flexible and suitable for various environments, including both embedded and networked settings. This feature shines especially for those using VMs or VPS, as it lets you replicate a Turso database right within your applications.

Embedded Replicas provide a smooth switch between local and remote database operations, allowing the same database to adapt to various scenarios effortlessly. They also ensure speedy data access by syncing local copies with the remote database, enabling microsecond-level read operations &mdash; a significant advantage for scenarios demanding quick data retrieval.
