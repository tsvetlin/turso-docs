Turso supports microsecond latency by giving you the control of where your data is stored, and replicated for super fast data access. Turso automatically manages keeping data up to date, so you can focus on building.

Databases belong to a group. A group has a primary location, and additional replica locations. The number of locations you can use depends on your plan &mdash; [see pricing](https://turso.tech/pricing).

## Primary

All databases have a primary location (region) where data is stored. You can configure the primary location for groups using the Turso CLI and Turso Platform API.

## Replicas

Databases can be replicated to other regions closer to your users by adding more locations to the group your database belongs to.
