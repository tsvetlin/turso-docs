You can always find a summary of all commands by running the following command:

```bash
turso help
```

You can also find out more about each command, as well as any required or optional arguments by passing the `--help` flag to the command:

```bash
turso auth --help
turso db create --help
```

If you require support integrating Turso into your project, [we can help](/support).
