description: Get started with Turso and Python using the LibSQL client in a few simple steps
---

In this Python quickstart we will learn how to:

- Install the Python LibSQL client
- Connect to a remote Turso database
- Execute a query using SQL

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install libsql-client">

First begin by installing the `libsql-client`:

```bash
pip install libsql-client
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize a new client">

Next initialize a new client using `libsql_client`:

```python
import libsql_client

client = libsql_client.create_client(
  url="libsql://"
  auth_token="..."
)
```

You can also connect to a local SQLite file by passing `file:` path instead, [learn

  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute a query using SQL">

You can execute a SQL query against your existing database by calling `execute()`:

```python
async with client:
  result = await client.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
```

If you need to use placeholders for values, you can do that:

<CodeGroup>

```python Positional
async with client:
  result = await client.execute(
    "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?",
    [1]
  )
```

```python Named
async with client:
  result = await client.execute(
    "INSERT INTO users VALUES (:name)",
    { "name": "Iku" }
  )
```

</CodeGroup>

  </Step>
</Steps>
